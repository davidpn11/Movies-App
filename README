For using this you need to create a API KEY for https://www.themoviedb.org.

To do this, enter the website, create an account and create an API key.
Then add your API key to gradle.properties as:
API_KEY = “abcdef”

To access in code, go to NetworkUtils.java and add:
private static final String API_KEY = BuildConfig.API_KEY; 


And you’re done ;)
